## Inspiration
This site was made at the request of local shop who wanted to step-up their game and get more people to know about the shop. It was a chance for me as well since I wanted to try doing an entire html page from scratch. No bootstrap or other framework was used - all vanilla js and css. The site is too small and dependencies would take more bandwith than site itself.

## Search engine optimization

List of things that has been applied to improve SEO rating:
- Images
   - Nextgen image formats: webp (Chrome) and jp2 (Safari)
   - Lazy loading for images
   - 'Alt' attribute added to all images
- Site
   - Added 'description' as meta attribute
   - Added favicon
   - Added 'theme-color'
   - Google Search Console support in header
   - Internal linkinking on page
- .htaccess:
   - Redirect to 'https' from 'http'
   - Content policy
   - Custom 404 page
- Other
   - CSS and JS minification
   - Added sitemap.xml
   - Google Search Console passed mobility friendly test
   - Added facebook page pointing to the site

## DevOps
Since I didn't use any builiding tool for the site I wrote scripts to make my life easier:
 - deploy.sh - copies all necessary files from the project to new folder (ready to be copy-pasted into server)
 - minify_css_and_js.sh - minifies js and css. In use by 'deploy.sh'. Probably won't be called on its own.
 - minify_html.sh - minifies html

For image optimalization and conversion I have used ImageMagick and Gimp.
